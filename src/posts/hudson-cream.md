[Hudson Cream](https://www.hudsoncream.com/)

We're located in Hudson, Kansas (pop. 125) and are now one of the last independent flour mills remaining in the U.S. While we've made a few improvements over the years, added a couple of flour bins and put in more roll stands, our purpose has stayed the same: produce the best quality flour possible at a fair price.

Hudson Cream Flour is made using a "short patent" milling process, a method that was much more common a century ago than today. The difference is that in short patent milling the wheat is ground more times and sifted with finer-meshed sieves than in standard milling. Also, the short patent process sifts away more by-product, leaving only the heart of the wheat kernel to make Hudson Cream flour. The result is a flour that is smoother in texture and produces baked goods that are consistently light and fluffy.

Our specialty is flour for the home baker. We're recognized by the distinctive cow logo, and we're often asked: how does a cow symbolize flour? In the early 1900s when the mill was built, many people owned their own cows for milking and it was commonly believed that the Jersey cow produced the best milk and cream. The mill's founder chose the Jersey cow and the word "cream" to symbolize the white richness, smooth texture, and high quality of the flour.

We take pride in being a company that actively supports the community: whether through sponsoring the local high school, being an active supporter of the county 4-H program, educating all ages through the dozens of tours given of the mill each year, providing flour for various service organizations fundraisers, helping at the area health fair, or providing equipment for the volunteer fire department, we believe that a healthy community builds strong citizens.
